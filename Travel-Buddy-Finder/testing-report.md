# Travel Buddy Finder - Matching System Analysis & Fixes

## 1. Issues Identified

### Frontend Issues
1. SwipeToMatch Component:
   - No error handling for failed API calls in loadPotentialMatches
   - Missing loading states during swipe actions
   - Potential memory leak in useEffect cleanup
   - No validation for minimum swipe distance

2. SwipeCard Component:
   - Touch events not properly handled on mobile devices
   - Missing accessibility features
   - No visual feedback during swipe actions
   - Profile details modal can interfere with swipe gestures

### Backend Issues
1. Matching Algorithm:
   - Match score calculation doesn't consider language compatibility
   - No weighting for travel dates overlap
   - Missing validation for active user status
   - No handling of edge cases (empty preferences)

2. Socket Service:
   - Rate limiting implementation could cause memory leaks
   - Missing reconnection handling
   - No cleanup for stale socket connections
   - Inefficient match score calculation
